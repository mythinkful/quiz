Allow the user to input his or her response to each questions with radio buttons for the user to enter their response
When the user answers the last question, the quiz should show his or her overall score
Each question should be stored as a JavaScript object, and you’ll want to store your list of questions in an array. For example: var questions = [{question: "What is the capital of the US", choices: ["Washington DC", "NYC", "Silicon Valley"], correct:0}];
